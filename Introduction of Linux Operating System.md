		Shell 
		
			§ It is the outer layer of UNIX operating System. 
		
			§ It reads our command, verify syntax and check whether the corresponding command related application is available or not. 
		
			§ If everything is proper, then shell interprets our command into kernal understandable form and handover to the kernal. 
		
			§ Shell acts as interface between user and kernal. 
		
		Kernel
		
			§ It is the core component of UNIX operating system. 
		
			§ It is responsible to execute our commands. 
		
			§ It is responsible to interact with hardware components. 
		
			§ Memory allocation and processor allocation will takes care by kernal. 
	
	
	
# Command Execution Flow

			§ When User types the command in the terminal. Eq. touch durga.txt 
		
			§ Shell reads that command. It will check whether that command is valid or not and whether it is used properly or not. If everything is proper, then shell interprets/translates that command into kernel understandable form. 
		
			§ Shell handovers that interpreted command to the kernel. 
		
			§ Kernal executes that command and perform required activity. 
		
			§ Once command execution completed, then shell returns Unix prompt ($ OR # OR %). 
		
			§ $ OR # OR % represents it is ready for the next command.
